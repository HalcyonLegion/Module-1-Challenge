# Horiseon SEO Marketing Agency - Code Refactoring Challenge

## Description

I was tasked with putting myself in the shoes of a junior developer who needed to refactor the code for Horiseon's website.
The original HTML code contained several examples of non-semantic elements and was lacking a title. The CSS was repetitive and almost 200 lines.
This task was designed to prepare me for scenarios I may encounter in the real world as a developer and as such can be applied to several real-world tasks.
I learned how to consolidate code, cut out useless classes/IDs and streamline the overall website. I also learned about semantic elements in HTML which are becoming the standard.

## Installation

Please visit this URL to see how the website looks now: https://halcyonlegion.github.io/Module-1-Challenge/

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

I learned about semantic vs non-semantic elements here: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
